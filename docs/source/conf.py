# -- Path setup --------------------------------------------------------------

# If extensions (or modules to document with autodoc) are in another directory,
# add these directories to sys.path here. If the directory is relative to the
# documentation root, use os.path.abspath to make it absolute, like shown here.

import os.path as osp
import sys

# caveat: Without specifying the correct system path to make RTD import
#         the modules in the local directory, RTD will import the installed
#         modules and the autodoc will never change.
sys.path.insert(0, osp.abspath('../..'))

# -- Project information -----------------------------------------------------

# The version info for the project you're documenting, acts as replacement for
# |version| and |release|, also used in various other places throughout the
# built documents.
#
# The short X.Y version.
# import pyfoamalgo
# # This is the released version in conda-forge
# version = pyfoamalgo.__version__
# # The full version, including alpha/beta/rc tags.

# -- General configuration ---------------------------------------------------

# Add any Sphinx extension module names here, as strings. They can be
# extensions coming with Sphinx (named 'sphinx.ext.*') or your custom
# ones.

    'sphinx.ext.autodoc',
    'sphinx.ext.intersphinx',

# Add any paths that contain templates here, relative to this directory.

# directories to ignore when looking for source files.
# This pattern also affects html_static_path and html_extra_path.

# -- Options for HTML output -------------------------------------------------

# The theme to use for HTML and HTML Help pages.  See the documentation for
# a list of builtin themes.
#
html_theme = 'sphinx_rtd_theme'

# Add any paths that contain custom static files (such as style sheets) here,
# relative to this directory. They are copied after the builtin static files,
# so a file named "default.css" will overwrite the builtin "default.css".
